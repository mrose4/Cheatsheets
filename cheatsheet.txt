wc = word count--but dont type this without anything becasue your terminal will crash
# whenever your terminal crashes (e.g. you no longer see a dollar sign) you can type control c
To use wc:
    You can type characters and then have it count it--have to use a | (pipe) here
    e.g. echo "Hello from the command line" | wc -wc
        this counts the number of the words
    e.g cat cheatsheet.txt | wc -w
    You can also use another command (-l) to count lines
    e.g. cat cheatsheet.txt | wc -l
>  to create new files    
e.g. cat cheatsheet.txt | sort > sorted.txt
the above command would first created a sorted text and then make a new version of it

    make sure you are in the directory where the file is currently
    then type:
        mv nypl_items.csv ~/Desktop/projects/
